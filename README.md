# MaterialBadgeTextView
As the name describes, this is an Android library that you can use to show new messages badge and new features badge.  
More importantly, it has a default shadow like FAB(Floating Action Button) and more simple to use just like ordinary TextView.

## Why you need this library
1. You know, the **Shadow** & **Elevation** is Material Design core element. So...
2. Like TextView, you didn't need to care about **background shadow, width, height, and the limit of numbers**. Just set text, textColor and TextSize in layout xml, or call setBadgeCount(), setHighLightMode() method in source code...
