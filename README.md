# MaterialBadgeTextView
As the name describes, this is an Android library that you can use to show new messages badge and new features badge.

## Why you need this library
1. You know, the Shadow&Elevation is Material Design core element. So...
2. Like TextView, you didn't need to care about background shadow, width, height, the limit of numbers. Just set textColor and TextSize.


If you use mac X, you must have seen this new message badge view:
